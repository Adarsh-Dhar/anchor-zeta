# Solana Wallet Adapter Implementation

## Overview
The Universal NFT application has been successfully integrated with the Solana Wallet Adapter to enable wallet connection functionality.

## Components Added

### 1. SolanaProvider (`app/components/SolanaProvider.tsx`)
- Provides Solana connection context to the entire application
- Configures wallet adapters for popular Solana wallets
- Sets up connection to Solana devnet
- Wraps the application with necessary providers

### 2. WalletConnect (`app/components/WalletConnect.tsx`)
- Replaces the old mock wallet connection UI
- Uses the official `WalletMultiButton` from Solana wallet adapter
- Automatically handles wallet connection/disconnection
- Displays wallet address when connected

## Supported Wallets
The following wallet adapters are currently configured:
- **Phantom** - Most popular Solana wallet
- **Solflare** - Feature-rich Solana wallet
- **Torus** - Web3 wallet with social login
- **Ledger** - Hardware wallet support
- **Solong** - Multi-chain wallet

## How It Works

1. **Provider Setup**: The `SolanaProvider` wraps the entire application and provides:
   - Connection to Solana devnet
   - Wallet adapter context
   - Wallet modal provider

2. **Wallet Connection**: Users can:
   - Click the "Connect Wallet" button
   - Choose from available wallet options
   - Connect their preferred wallet
   - See their wallet address displayed

3. **Integration**: The wallet connection state is automatically managed by the Solana wallet adapter, providing:
   - Real wallet addresses
   - Connection status
   - Disconnect functionality

## Usage

### For Users
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top-right corner
3. Select your preferred Solana wallet
4. Approve the connection in your wallet
5. Your wallet address will be displayed

### For Developers
The wallet connection state can be accessed in any component using:
```typescript
import { useWallet } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react';

const { publicKey, connected, disconnect } = useWallet();
```

## Network Configuration
- Currently configured for **Solana Devnet**
- Can be easily changed to mainnet-beta or testnet by modifying the `network` variable in `SolanaProvider.tsx`

## Dependencies Added
- `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`
- `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`
- `@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets`
- `@solana/wallet-adapter-base`

## Testing
1. Start the development server: `yarn dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
3. Try connecting with a Solana wallet (Phantom recommended for testing)
4. Verify that the wallet address is displayed correctly

## Next Steps
- Implement actual Solana program interactions using the connected wallet
- Add transaction signing capabilities
- Integrate with the Universal NFT smart contract
- Add wallet balance display
- Implement NFT minting and transfer functionality
